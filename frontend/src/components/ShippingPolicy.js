          The customer will usually get an order in 3-5 business days after the
          order has shipped out. After your payment is authorized, it can take
          up to 2 days for us to process your order and ship it. This is just an
          estimate and does not include weekends and holidays. We do not ship to
          P.O Boxes. Delivery can take longer in remote areas in Pakistan.
